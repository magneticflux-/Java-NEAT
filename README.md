# Java-NEAT
This project aims to make an extendable, easy to use system for implementing a NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) evolutionary algorithm. ~~It uses the Watchmaker Evolutionary Framework, which provides an excellent basis for general evolutionary systems.~~ It includes classes for, and must be built with, [JNSGA-II](https://github.com/magneticflux-/JNSGA-II).
